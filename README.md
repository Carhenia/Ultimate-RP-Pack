An original pack by Carhenia, you may know me from my Youtube series, Nebula High. This modpack is a collection of some of my favourite mods that I've used on my roleplay series previously, including building, world gen, animation, player model and camera mods. This modpack is intended for recording youtube roleplay series, some of the tools included are advanced and will require some research prior to using them. Please consider visiting the full mods list, where I have added information about what each mod is intended for.

- __**Please Note:**__ This is a VERY resource heavy modpack, expect long loading times if you don't have a great PC, please consider removing mods you are not using to reduce resource load. I used to record on a server so it would take on most of the load.  

This repository is a collection of file modifications specifically created for the custom modpack. These modifications include changes to various configuration files such as .toml, .cfg, .txt, .json, and others. These files have been modified to ensure that the modpack functions correctly and provides the desired gameplay experience.

This modpack is maintained by Carhenia for [Nebula Network](https://nebulanetwork.net)
